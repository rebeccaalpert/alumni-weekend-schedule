# alumni-weekend-schedule

Responsive schedule for Tufts Alumni Weekend, developed for Tufts Marketing. Users can filter the schedule by class to view special, class-specific reunion events.

View it in action on at [tuftsalumni.org/awschedule](http://tuftsalumni.org/awschedule).

Built with the Bootstrap 3 front-end framework. JQuery and CSS were used to implement the filtering scheme.
